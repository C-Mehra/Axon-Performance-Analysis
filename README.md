Axon Sales Dashboard


## Problem Statement

Axon, a small retailer specializing in classic miniature automobile models, currently faces challenges in managing and analyzing its sales data. The absence of a centralized system has left the sales team struggling to extract meaningful insights, hindering effective decision-making for the management. In response, Axon aims to address this issue by implementing a Business Intelligence (BI) solution.

The proposed project seeks to design and implement a BI solution utilizing Microsoft PowerBI and SQL. The key objectives are to:

1. Establish a seamless integration of sales data from the MySQL database into PowerBI.
2. Employ data cleaning and transformation processes to ensure the data is prepared for in-depth analysis.
3. Develop interactive dashboards and reports within PowerBI to facilitate comprehension of sales data by the sales team and management.
4. Utilize SQL for advanced analytics, extracting insights that can potentially enhance the company's sales strategy.
5. Enable real-time access to dashboards and reports, empowering the management to make informed, data-driven decisions.

By successfully implementing this BI solution, Axon aims to enhance its ability to manage, analyze, and leverage sales data for improved decision-making and overall business performance.


### Steps followed 

1. *Data Source Identification:*
I initiated the project by conducting a comprehensive analysis of our MySQL database, meticulously identifying key tables and fields that house pertinent sales data. Ensured a thorough understanding of the dataset to facilitate effective analysis.

2. *Data Extraction and Cleaning:*
Independently leveraging SQL queries and tools, I executed the extraction of sales data with a keen focus on precision. Methodically addressed data anomalies, including duplicate entries and missing values, ensuring a refined dataset for subsequent analysis.

3. *Load Data into PowerBI:*
Utilizing PowerBI as a sole operator, I established a direct connection to our MySQL database. Employed Power Query Editor to refine and shape the data, subsequently loading it into PowerBI to create a resilient dataset forming the cornerstone of our analytical endeavors.

4. *Design Dashboards and Reports:*
In an individual capacity, I curated visualizations within PowerBI, selecting optimal representations for key metrics and trends. Developed interactive dashboards and organized reports to enhance comprehension, delivering a seamless understanding of the analytical insights.

5. *Perform Advanced Analytics with SQL:*
Taking ownership of the analytical phase, I conducted advanced analytics using SQL. This encompassed the execution of queries, creation of pivot tables, and formulation of views, harnessing the capabilities of SQL for in-depth exploration of sales data.

6. *Deployment Strategy:*
For deployment, I orchestrated a methodical rollout, ensuring seamless integration with existing workflows. The strategy included a phased implementation to mitigate any potential disruptions, allowing the team to progressively adapt to the new BI solution.
